==================

`Notebooks <https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-lab-evolution-of-the-jupyter-notebook-5297cacde6b>`_ are documents that mix code (usually R or python), descriptive explainations, and visualizations. They're ideal for explaining an analysis. Also idea for tutorials because of the 'hands on' nature.
