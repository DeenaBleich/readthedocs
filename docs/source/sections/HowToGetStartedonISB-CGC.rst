******************
Getting started on the ISB-Cancer Genomics Cloud (ISB-CGC) powered by the Google Cloud Platform 
******************

The ISB-CGC provides both interactive (through a `web application <https://isb-cgc.appspot.com/>`_) and programmatic access to data hosted by institutes such as the Genomic Data Commons GDC of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, leveraging many aspects of the Google Cloud Platform.

Benefits of Using The Cloud
============================

You don’t have to download the data! Bring your compute and know-how to the data. Use cloud-native, compute scale as big as you can imagine, tools to analyze TBs and PBs of data!! 

Goals of this tutorial: 
========================

1. How to get started on the ISB-CGC powered by the Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
2. Learn about cloud credits offered by Google and ISB-CGC
3. Learn about data hosted on ISB-CGC
4. Learn about how to get authorization to access controlled cancer genomics data 
5. Setting up and registering a GCP project to use controlled access data
